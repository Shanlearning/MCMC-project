## Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 
MEPS is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers (doctors,
hospitals, pharmacies, etc.) and employers across the United States. MEPS
collects data on the specific health services that Americans use, how
frequently they use them, the cost of these services, and how they are paid
for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held
by and available to U.S. workers.
